        <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>

        <img class="avatar" src="https://i.imgur.com/T4EpAg6.png" />

        <p>
          I graduated in Techinical Business and Civil Engineering Technology. I have worked in the commercial area since 2011, but I have just started in commercial area of civil engineering and architecture projects in 2013 .<br><br> I started working with fintechs 2017 and I have noticed that it was an important change of path in my life because <strong>I may use it not only for my engineer vision</strong>, but <strong>also for my business vision to solve problems</strong> and make the business rise. <br><br>Although many people do not agree, I believe that technical knowledge and business vision in addition to passion for the customer, should go together and for this reason I have a strong appreciation for always knowing the product or service on which I work, in depth and doing everything so that the client has the best experience possible. <br><br>Great passion for continuous improvement, to the point of plunging into the universe of systems development and endeavoring to match my sales and relationship know-how with the systems analyst vision to develop better solutions for the financial market.

Thus, being able to act from salesperson, through CRM analyst, sales engineer, business analyst or even as a developer! <br><br>In short: if I have to become a programmer or run the marketing and sales front or even mix the two things to sell more, I won't think twice about getting down to business.
